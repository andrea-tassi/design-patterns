# Interpreter

"Interpresters are all around us. Even now, in this very room"

A compnent that processes structured text data. 
Does so by turning it into separate lexical tokens (lexing) and
then intepreting sequences of said tokens (parsing).

## Motivation

- Textual input needs to be processed.
   - E.g. turned into OOP structures.
- Some examples:
   - Programming language compilers, interpreters and IDEs.
   - HTML, XML and similar.
   - Numeric expressions.
   - Regular expressions.
- Turning strings into OOP based structures in a complcated process.

## Summary

- Barring simple cases, an interpreter acts into two stages:
   - Lexing turns text into a set of tokens.
   - Parsing tokens into meaningful constructs. 
- Parsed data can be traversed.
