# SOLID design principles

*"Useful principles of object-oriented design."*

## Motivation

- Design principles introduced by Robert C. Martin.
- Frequently referred in Design Pattern literature.

## Summary

- Single Responsibility Principle
  - A class should only have one reason to change.
  - Separation of concerns - different classes handling differentm independent tasks/problems.
- Open-Closed Principle
  - Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle
  - You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.
- Interface Segragation Principle
  - Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces.
  - YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It
- Dependency Inversion Principle
  - High-level modules should not depend upon low level ones; use abstractions.
