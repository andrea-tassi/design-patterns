# Decorator

Adding behavior without altering the class itself.

## Motivation

- Want to augment an object with additional functionality.
- Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code (OCP).
- Want to keep new functionality separate (SRP).
- Need to be able to interact with existing structures.
-  Two options:
   -  Aggregate the decorator object
   -  Inherit form the decorated object.
